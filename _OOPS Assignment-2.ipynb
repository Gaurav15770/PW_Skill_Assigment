    "#### Ans- Abstraction in object-oriented programming (OOP) is a concept that focuses on providing a simplified and generalized view of objects and their essential features. It involves representing complex real-world entities as classes and hiding unnecessary details, allowing users to interact with objects at a higher level of abstraction."

    "#### Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Abstraction is about providing a simplified and generalized view of objects and their essential features.\n",
    "* It emphasizes hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the relevant and essential aspects of an object.\n",
    "* Abstraction focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "* It helps in managing complexity, enhancing modularity, and providing a clear interface for interaction with objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation is about bundling related data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit, often known as a class.\n",
    "* It promotes the idea of data protection and access control by encapsulating the data and exposing it only through well-defined methods.\n",
    "* Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of an object is hidden from the outside, and access to the object's data is controlled through methods.\n",
    "* It helps in achieving data abstraction, data protection, and modular programming."

    "\n",
    "Provide a Public Interface: Expose a public interface for interacting with the class. This interface should define methods or properties that allow users to perform necessary operations on the data without needing to know the internal implementation details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract the Data: Abstract the data by providing high-level methods or properties that represent the essential characteristics or functionality of the object. Users should be able to interact with these high-level abstractions without being concerned about the underlying complexities."
